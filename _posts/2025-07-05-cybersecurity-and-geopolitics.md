These are th steps I followed in order to gain my dream expertise:

Step 1: IT Foundations  
I started with the basics — the “alphabet” of tech. Cables, ports, protocols. I learned that turning it off and on again is not just a meme — it’s a sacred ritual.

Step 2: Operating Systems & File Systems  
This is where I discovered that computers have feelings. Or at least logs. So many logs. And that deleting a file doesn’t mean it’s gone — it just goes to the digital version of Narnia.

Step 3: Network Infrastructure  
I met TCP/IP, the introverts of the internet. I learned how data travels, how routers gossip, and how firewalls are basically bouncers for your packets.

Step 4: Linux  
Ah, Linux — the operating system that rewards curiosity and punishes typos. I now speak fluent `sudo`, and I’ve made peace with the fact that I will never remember all the flags for `grep`.

Step 5: Microsoft Server Technologies  
I ventured into the land of Active Directory, where users roam free and permissions are a political minefield. I learned that Group Policy is both a blessing and a curse.

Step 6: Cloud Computing Foundations  
I discovered that “the cloud” is just someone else’s computer — but with more acronyms. IAM, S3, EC2… it’s like Pokémon (just kidding more like Digimon), but for sysadmins.

Step 7: Introduction to Information Security  
This is where I realized that paranoia is a job requirement. I learned about CIA (not the spies — the triad), threat models, and why “123456” is still a thing in 2025.

Step 8: Security and Law  
I dove into the legal side of cyber, where GDPR, NIS2, and the Budapest Convention sound like indie bands but are actually very serious documents.

Step 9: CyberOps  
Here I learned how to detect, respond, and pretend I’m in a cyber thriller. SIEMs, SOCs, and the art of staring at dashboards like they’re ancient runes. And it is here that i learnt that I should be more careful about the color of my hat.

What’s next for me?

Coming soon to a brain near me:
- **Cloud Security**: Because the cloud needs bodyguards too.
- **Programming**: So I can finally stop copying scripts from Stack Overflow (maybe).
- **SQL & Databases**: Learning how to interrogate data without making it cry.
- **Ethical Hacking**: Breaking into systems *legally* — the dream.
- **Computer Forensics**: CSI: Cyber Edition. I’ll be the one dusting hard drives for fingerprints.

Final Thoughts

Becoming a cybersecurity expert feels like learning a new language, except the grammar changes every week and the vocabulary includes things like “zero-day” and “buffer overflow.” But I love it. It’s practical, it’s strategic, and it’s just the right amount of chaotic.

And if I ever do explain it to my grandparents, I’ll just say:  
> “I keep the internet safe. And yes, I can make the text bigger on your phone — again.”
